## Course Boilerplate Code

Copy and paste folder to start a new TypeScript project.

- created basic HTML5 doc and linked it to `app.js`, which is compiled from `app.ts`.
- ran `npm init` (all default settings)
- added `lite-server` to `start` script on package.json
- added `.gitingore` to skip all subsequent `node_modules` folders by default

**NOTE:** make sure to run `npm install` as the `node_modules` folder is retracted by default.
