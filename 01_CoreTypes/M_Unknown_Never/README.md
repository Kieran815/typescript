# Course Section 1M: Unknown & Never

Covers Sections:

## The Unknown Type

- `unknown` type variables allow any value assignment
- regardless of value type, `unknown` type will still be `unknown`
- better than `any`, which ignores type errors
- errors fixed by adding type-checking statements to code

## The Never Type

- `never` indicates that a function will NEVER RETURN ANYTHING
- different from `void`, which IGNORES return values
- used frequently in debugging
